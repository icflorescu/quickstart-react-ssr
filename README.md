# Another Universal React Application Quickstart

## What's this

This is my own contribution to the [JS-fatigue](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4).

## How to use

- Simply clone it and use it as a starting point for your application;
- Have a look at `scripts` in `package.json` to understand what's what;
- Make sure to update dependencies, they'll probably be outdated;
- Please don't ask for _pro-bono_ advice; there are many resources you can learn from. If you're just starting with JS or React, set your homepage to [this site](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and make sure to regularly check the available [udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and [egghead](https://egghead.io/) courses. They're very good.
